# Requests Contract

A sample smart contract with functions to create withdrawal and consolidation requests.

Remember that to be able to create requests for a particular validator, the validator needs to have its withdrawal credential matching the contract address.

TODO: add step-by-step on how to use this contract in Remix or similar.
